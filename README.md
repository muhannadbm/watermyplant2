🪴🪴🪴🪴 Proposal 🪴🪴🪴🪴

What problem does your app solve?	
Many people have a hard time forming habits that stick. This niche app will hopefully help form the habit of watering any household plant on a regular basis! The user will be able to sign up, input their information and their plants information in order to keep track of how often and how much water the plant will need.

Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

The user will be able to sign up, input their information and their plants information in order to keep track of how often and how much water the plant will need. The app will also keep track of the last time the user watered and count down the time until the user will need to water the plant again. The user will be notified once it is time for one of the plants to be watered again.


What is the mission statement?
Don’t let your plants die of thirst
